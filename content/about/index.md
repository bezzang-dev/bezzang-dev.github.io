## Summary

I graduated from Kookmin University with a major in Software and am currently a junior developer focusing on backend development and DevOps.

I have experience building backend web applications using Java Spring, containerizing applications with Docker, and establishing CI/CD pipelines on AWS using GitHub Actions.

I enjoy collaborating and discussing with team members to always find the optimal solution, and I aspire to contribute as a backend developer providing stable and efficient services to users.
